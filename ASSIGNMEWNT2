In today's society, statistics is looked upon and used amongst many people. The article I read Teaching The Social Construction of Statistics is very interesting and gives many valid and knowledgeable information. The main idea of the article is that statistics is based on the people and more importantly their decisions as well. Statistics is the practice of collecting data which is technically controlled by the people. In addition, there are different ways of presenting the data with different purposes as well. For example, the article quoted “The average US farm was 440 acres; the average US family farm was 326 acres”. Another example the article states is “In 2005, the world gained 2.3 people per second (over 74 million people per year). In other words, the article was giving examples of statistics and how it can be shown. As a result, there are different forms of data being presented and each shown for its own reason. Furthermore, statistics are very important in the world today and is used by mostly everyone to prove a point. Overall, statistics plays a big role in our society and more importantly is based on the people and their decisions.
